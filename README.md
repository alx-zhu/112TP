112 Term Project
Andy’s Labyrinth
Description:
For the 112 Term Project, I created a Rogue-lite dungeon crawler game called Andy’s Labyrinth. 
This game is modeled after classic and popular dungeon crawlers such as Hades, Undertale, and Dungreed. 
This game is made up of a few core aspects; The player controls a character that can platform through rooms in the dungeon. 
The dungeon is made up of several separate rooms, that are connected through the creation of a randomly generated maze. 
The player defeats enemies and gradually collects new weapons as they progress. 
When the player dies, or completes the dungeon, the game does not end (which is a key characteristic of a Rogue-lite); 
the player will receive permanent stat increases and restart in a new maze, and if they complete the dungeon, the enemies will increase in difficulty. 
At the moment, there is only one variety of enemy, but more complex enemies would be implemented in the future, including bosses.
